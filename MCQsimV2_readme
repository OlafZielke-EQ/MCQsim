This repository hosts MCQsim, a multi-cycle earthquake rupture simulator for generation of earthquake sequences along predefined faults or fault systems of arbitrary geometric complexity.
The updated code version includes QuadTree and H-matrix approximation of the stiffness kernel to improve code efficiency and scalability.

DOWNLOADING MCQsim
  To download individual folders:

  Open a browser tab and go to
  https://download-directory.github.io

  Copy and paste the GitHub site you want to download, such as:
  https://github.com/OlafZielke-EQ/MCQsim/tree/main/forTREAD/IO_standalone_MAC
  for the OSX/MAC version of the standalone I/O GUIs 

  or:
  https://github.com/OlafZielke-EQ/MCQsim/tree/main/00_Cstuff
  for the MCQsim source code 

  This will download the folders.



INSTALLATION
MCQSIM INPUT/OUTPUT
  I/O includes model and parameter setup (input) and various ways to visualize simulations results (output, e.g., individual earthquakes and earthquake catalogs).
  Input/output for MCQsim is done through MATLAB-based GUIs i.e., standalone versions thereof (i.e., no MATLAB licence required). The latter are currently for OSX/MAC and Ubuntu.
 
  for MATLAB: start the *.p files by typing for example:
  A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREAD
  in the MATLAB command window and then press enter.

  for standalone GUIs:
  Install by double-clicking the *.app file (e.g., Ainput_MCQsim.app) and then follow the instructions. 
  IMPORTANT: The installation process includes downloading MATLAB resources that are needed to run the GUIs (automatically done during installation, accessing the mathworks.com page).



MCQSIM CODE COMPILATION
  MCQsim is written in C, parallelized with MPI. It further uses BLAS (provided via GSL or else). These libraries must be accessible during compilation/run-time.
  MCQsim compilation/installation is done in the command window i.e., terminal.

Compilation on OSX/MAC
  mpicc   MCQsim_Main.c   MCQsim_StrainHS.c   MCQsim_StrainFS.c   -lm  -lgslcblas  -lmpich  -Wall  -O3  -o  MCQsim

  this compiliation assumes use of BLAS provided by GSL (hence, GSL needs to be accessible as well).

Compilation on OSX/MAC
  mpicc   MCQsim_Main.c   MCQsim_StrainHS.c   MCQsim_StrainFS.c   -lm  -lgslcblas  -lmpich  -Wall  -O3  -o  MCQsim

  It might be necessary to check if the required modules are available/accessible. Check via:

  module avail

  and then load the required modules (such as GSL and/or MPI) for example

  module load mpich
  module load gsl



MCQSIM SIMULATION
  Assuming you have all required input and parameter files defined, you can start the simulation via:

  mpirun -n 6 ./MCQsim ParameterFile.txt

  This command will start MCQsim as an MPI run, using n = 6 CPUs. The parameter file contains relevant information to start/control the simulation.
