This repository hosts MCQsim, a multi-cycle earthquake rupture simulator for generation of earthquake sequences along predefined faults or fault systems of arbitrary geometric complexity.
We are currently putting together the documentation for MCQsim. That said, you can always reach out to us about how to use the code etc.
The current code version is V2. It includes H-matrix approximation of the stiffness kernel to improve code efficiency and scalability.
