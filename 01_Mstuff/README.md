# MCQSIM I/O
  This includes model and parameter setup (input) and various ways to visualize simulations results (output, e.g., individual earthquakes and earthquake catalogs). Input/output for MCQsim is done through MATLAB-based graphical user interfaces GUIs i.e., standalone versions thereof (i.e., no MATLAB licence required). Standalone versions for OSX, Windows, and Linux are currently provided within the "TREAD" folder only.
  
  **for MATLAB:** 
  
  open MATLAB and start a GUI by typing e.g.
  
> _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREAD_

in the MATLAB command window and then press enter.

 **for standalone GUIs:**
  
  Install by double-clicking the installation file (e.g., _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREADinstall.app_ or _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREAD_install.exe_) and then follow the instructions. 
  
  **_IMPORTANT:_** This installation process includes downloading MATLAB resources from mathworks.com that are needed to run the GUIs. This should happen automatically during the installation process but can be a bit slow.
  
  **_IMPORTANT:_** It appears that sudo rights are necessary to install the standalones on Ubuntu.
