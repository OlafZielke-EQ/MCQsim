# MCQSIM I/O
_MCQsim_ GUIs are used for creating simulation input files (input GUIs) and for various ways to visualize simulations results (output GUIs, e.g., individual earthquakes and earthquake catalogs). Here, we provide _*.pcode_ files for these _MATLAB_-based GUIs. That is, you will need a _MATLAB_ licence to run these GUIs. We also provide ***standalone GUI versions*** of input and output GUIs that ***require no _MATLAB_ licence***. Instead, these standalone versions will -as part of the installation process- download/install a "_MATLAB_ runtime" which is free of charge. Currently, we provide standalone versions for OSX, Windows, and Linux within the _"TREAD"_ folder only of this repository.
  
  **for MATLAB:** 
  
  open MATLAB and start a GUI by typing e.g.
  
> _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREAD_

in the MATLAB command window and then press enter.

 **for standalone GUIs:**
  
  Install by double-clicking the installation file (e.g., _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREADinstall.app_ or _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREAD_install.exe_) and then follow the instructions. 
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
This installation process includes downloading MATLAB resources from mathworks.com that are needed to run the GUIs. This should happen automatically during the installation process but can be a bit slow.
  
  **_IMPORTANT:_** It appears that sudo rights are necessary to install the standalones on Ubuntu.
