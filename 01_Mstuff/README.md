# MCQSIM I/O
_MCQsim_ GUIs are used for creating simulation input files (input GUIs) and for various ways to visualize simulations results (output GUIs, e.g., individual earthquakes and earthquake catalogs). Here, we provide _*.pcode_ files for these _MATLAB_-based GUIs. That is, you will need a _MATLAB_ licence to run these GUIs. We also provide ***standalone GUI versions*** of input and output GUIs that ***require no _MATLAB_ licence***. Instead, these standalone versions will -as part of the installation process- download/install a "_MATLAB_ runtime" which is free of charge. The _MATLAB_ runtime can also be installed manually through [mathworks.com](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). Currently, we provide standalone versions for OSX, Windows, and Linux within the [_"TREAD"_](https://github.com/OlafZielke-EQ/MCQsim/tree/main/TREAD) folder only of this repository.
  
  ### MATLAB GUIs 
  
  open _MATLAB_ and start a GUI by typing e.g.
  
> _A2_MCQsim_EnterFault_

in the _MATLAB_ command window and then press enter.

### standalone GUIs
  
Install by double-clicking the installation file (e.g., _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREADinstall.app_ or _A_Geometry_MCQsim_TREAD_install.exe_) and then follow the instructions. **_IMPORTANT:_** It appears that sudo rights might be necessary to install the standalones on Ubuntu.
